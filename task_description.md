## task_description

Mice were head-restrained and indicated one of two choices by licking to one of two lick-ports (‘‘lick left/lick right’’) after hearing a “go” cue. 
In this task, the computer selected one port as the “correct” (i.e. rewarded) port and maintained this designation before switching at random to the other port after 4 to 8 trials were rewarded. 
The first lick after the go cue was used to select a port and water was only delivered on the offset of this lick, motivating the animal to lick again to test if a reward was delivered (and subsequently continue licking to collect reward, if present). 
The optimal strategy in this task is to implement win-->repeat and lose-->switch behaviors and to avoid executing win-->switch and lose-->repeat behaviors on two consecutive trials. 

This task was designed by Gil Mandelbaum and Zengcai Guo in the [Sabatini Lab](https://sabatini.hms.harvard.edu/) and [Svobda Lab](https://sabatini.hms.harvard.edu/). Zengcai Guo currently lead the Neural Circuits and Behavior lab at [Tsinghua University](http://circuits-ai.org/)
